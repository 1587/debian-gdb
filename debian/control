Description: The GNU Debugger
 GDB is a source-level debugger, capable of breaking programs at
 any specific line, displaying variable values, and determining
 where errors occurred. Currently, it works for C, C++, Fortran
 Modula 2, Ada, Java and Objective-C programs. A must-have for any
 serious programmer.
