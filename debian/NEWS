gdb (7.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  WARNING: gdb will use Python 3 by default for jessie.
  
  Please update your Python scripts to work on both Python 2 and 3 as soon
  as possible; the "six" module may be useful for inspiration here.
  
  Users who find this problematic may use python-gdb2 as a stopgap, but
  any package supplying GDB scripts that depend on one or the other IS
  BUGGY.  Anyone caught using Depends:, Conflicts:, or Breaks: to force
  one or the other WILL be dealt with MOST SEVERELY.
  
  (However, if such bugs stem from GDB or Python doing something
  stupid, we'll be lenient.)
