gdb (4.17-0.1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (differences with upstream 4.16.98 are negligable).
  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Disabled linking -rpath:
    * bfd/configure.in, opcodes/configure.in: applied libtool-rpath-workaround
    * gdb/configure.in, gdb/configure: don't use -rpath on Linux.
    * regenerate "configure" scripts involved.

gdb (4.16.98-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream code. Only change relevant on Linux: Patch by
    H.J. Lu so debugging of shared library works properly (That was
    the important patch motivating this upload).
    This release _is_ supposed to be the final gdb-4.17 (from the announce:
    'I wanted to make a "this is the release unless something is
    very wrong" release and then kick 4.17 out').

gdb (4.16.86-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream code. (still unreleased).

gdb (4.16.85-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Also remove gdb/doc/GDBvn.texi and config.log when cleaning up.
  * The following has been done by <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>:
  * TODO: this version of gdb uses an evil new version of libtool which
    forces -rpath. With lesstif, I got around this by replacing the libtool
    scripts with those from the Debian libtool package.
  * Use dynamic readline library.
  * Install with preserved timestamps.
  * Clean out .tab.c files missed by "make distclean", so the .diff.gz is
    smaller.
  * Clean out symlinks, so dpkg-source works after debian/rules build clean.
  * Several other minor clean-ups of the rules file.
  * Updated FSF address (lintian).
  * Bumped Standards-Version.
