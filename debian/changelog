gdb (4.16-2) unstable; urgency=MEDIUM

  * New caretaker: Stuart Lamble (note: this package is still up
    for adoption, as I would prefer not to be maintaining it
    full-time.)
  * Upgraded to the 2.1.1.0 source format.
  * Recompiled, with a corrected procfs.h, to correct problems with
    ELF coredumps.
  * Reformatted the changelog :-)
