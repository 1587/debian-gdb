      mistake; remove generated config.status files.

    (Closes: #137503).

    H.J. Lu so debugging of shared library works properly (That was
    the important patch motivating this upload).

  * debian/rules: Also remove gdb/doc/GDBvn.texi and config.log when cleaning up.
  * The following has been done by <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>:
  * TODO: this version of gdb uses an evil new version of libtool which
    forces -rpath. With lesstif, I got around this by replacing the libtool
    scripts with those from the Debian libtool package.
  * Use dynamic readline library.
  * Install with preserved timestamps.
  * Clean out .tab.c files missed by "make distclean", so the .diff.gz is
    smaller.
  * Clean out symlinks, so dpkg-source works after debian/rules build clean.
  * Several other minor clean-ups of the rules file.
  * Updated FSF address (lintian).
  * Bumped Standards-Version.
